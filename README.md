This repository hosts the **LLM-based ESG-Focused Portfolio Optimization Service** project. By integrating ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) criteria and advanced portfolio optimization techniques, this service provides users with a personalized ESG-driven investment portfolio. Using a large language model (LLM) to process and evaluate text data, the service enables investors to assess companies' ESG scores and generate optimized portfolios based on their preferences.

## Project Overview
In recent years, ESG has become a critical metric for assessing a company's long-term sustainability and stability. However, traditional ESG evaluation methods often lack transparency and accessibility for non-expert investors. This project addresses these issues by providing a user-centered, transparent ESG evaluation system using an LLM, which performs text-based assessments and applies the Black-Litterman model for portfolio optimization. Through this, the system generates customized portfolios that balance ESG factors and financial returns according to user preferences.

### Core Objectives
1. **Technical Implementation**: Develop a pipeline using LLM for ESG assessment and produce an optimized portfolio.
2. **User-Centered Service**: Provide personalized portfolio construction with ESG evaluation based on user-selected criteria and preferences.

## Key Features
1. **Text Data Collection and Processing**  
   - Collect articles related to selected companies from various sources using `Selenium` and `BeautifulSoup`, storing the data in `MongoDB` for efficient management.
   - Preprocess the collected data, anonymizing company names and filtering irrelevant content to ensure high data quality.
   
2. **LLM-based ESG Scoring**
   - Use an LLM (via the OpenAI API) to evaluate collected articles based on ESG relevance, extracting and labeling content by ESG factors and sentiment.
   - Fine-tune a `KoElectra` model for classification, allowing independent ESG assessments without API dependency.

3. **Comprehensive ESG Evaluation**
   - Utilize user input for adjusting weights on ESG factors (environmental, social, governance) to customize scoring.
   - Adjust scores dynamically based on investment style preferences: financial-centered, ESG-centered, or balanced.
   - Apply a scoring model that integrates multiple ESG rating agencies' criteria to build a comprehensive score, enabling evaluation for companies outside major agency coverage.

4. **Enhanced Portfolio Optimization via Black-Litterman Model**
   - Implement year-by-year optimization approach using ESG data from multiple rating agencies (MSCI, S&P, Sustainalytics, ISS, ESGÍ∏∞Ï§ÄÏõê).
   - Utilize the Ledoit-Wolf method for robust covariance matrix estimation, improving numerical stability.
   - Apply user trust weights to ESG scores, creating a personalized view vector for the Black-Litterman model.
   - Calculate optimized portfolio weights by maximizing the Sharpe ratio through quadratic programming with `scipy.optimize`.
   - Store and analyze yearly investment weights to track portfolio performance over time (2020-2025).
   - Implement robust error handling for data gaps and numerical computation issues.

5. **User Interface with Streamlit**
   - A user-friendly interface allows users to input ESG preferences and visualize optimized portfolios.
   - Interactive sliders for ESG weights and investment styles, providing an intuitive way to construct personalized portfolios.
   - Visualization of portfolio metrics, including expected return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fairyofdata/LLM-ESG-POS.git
   cd LLM-ESG-POS
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Streamlit Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Data Collection**: Configure company tickers and data sources for article collection.
2. **Set ESG Preferences**: Use the Streamlit UI to define weights for environmental, social, and governance factors.
3. **Investment Style Selection**: Choose from financial-centered, ESG-centered, or balanced portfolio options.
4. **View Portfolio Results**: See portfolio composition and performance metrics, including expected return and volatility.
